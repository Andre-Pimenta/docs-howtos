# How to use regular expressions

How do I use regex in an OutSystems Application?

## Answer

To use regular expressions in your applications add the **Regex\_Replace** and **Regex\_Search** actions from the **Text** extension as a dependency.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
The regular expression syntax will vary according to your stack.
Check the relevant reference for more information.

If you need to use advanced regular expression features create an Extension or use a Community created Forge component like [Text and HTML Processing](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/Component_Details.aspx?ProjectId=2007).
